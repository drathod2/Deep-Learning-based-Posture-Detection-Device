# Real-time Human Activity Recognition using Deep Learning

# Introduction

Our project uses a custom deep learning model deployed on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE for real-time human activity recognition, leveraging Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. The system seamlessly communicates with an ESP32, facilitating the transmission of activity data to Amazon Web Services (AWS) for secure storage in MongoDB. Users gain access to real-time activity insights through a user-friendly local HTML interface.

# Key Features

1. **Custom Deep Learning Model:**
   - The heart of our project lies in a purpose-built deep learning model that enables accurate real-time recognition of human activities. Trained on IMU sensor data, it ensures precision and responsiveness.

2. **Arduino Nano 33 BLE Deployment:**
   - The deep learning model is efficiently deployed on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, providing a compact and powerful solution for on-device activity recognition.

3. **Communication with ESP32:**
   - The system communicates seamlessly with an ESP32, establishing a reliable link for the transmission of activity data between the Arduino Nano 33 BLE and the ESP32.

4. **AWS Integration:**
   - Activity data is securely sent to AWS, offering a robust and scalable solution for data storage and facilitating further analysis.

5. **MongoDB Storage:**
   - AWS storage is backed by MongoDB, ensuring secure, scalable, and organized storage for long-term analysis and trend identification.

6. **Local HTML Interface:**
   - Users can easily visualize real-time activity insights through a user-friendly local HTML interface, providing a convenient way to monitor and interpret the system's output.
